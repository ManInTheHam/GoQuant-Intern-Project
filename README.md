#  Deribit API Price Fetcher (C++)

This project demonstrates how to connect to the [Deribit cryptocurrency exchange API](https://docs.deribit.com/) using **C++** and **libcurl**, to fetch the latest index prices for major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH.

---

## Features

- Fetches real-time index price from Deribit.
- Uses `libcurl` for HTTP requests.
- Clean and extensible structure.
- Command-line interface for symbol input.

---

## Requirements

- C++ Compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- libcurl development package

Install libcurl on Debian-based systems:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev


# How to Build
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

# How to Run
Once compiled, run the executable:
./deribit
You'll be prompted to enter a crypto symbol like BTC, ETH, or XRP. The program will then fetch and display the real-time index price from Deribit.


# Code Overview
fetch_from_api(): Handles the GET request to the Deribit endpoint using libcurl.

WriteCallback(): Used by libcurl to store the server's response in a string.

main(): Takes user input, builds the API URL, and prints the result.

# Deribit API Trading System in C++

This project is a trading system built in C++ for interacting with the Deribit Test API. It allows you to place, cancel, modify orders, view the order book, and retrieve current position details on the Deribit platform(https://test.deribit.com/). The project uses `cURL` for HTTP requests and `nlohmann/json` for JSON parsing.

## Features

- **Order Placement**: Submit orders at specific price and quantity for various instruments.
- **Order Management**: Cancel and modify existing orders.
- **Order Book Retrieval**: View detailed order book data including bids, asks, and market information.
- **Position Details**: Retrieve position details for a specific instrument.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: GCC (recommended) or any modern C++ compiler with C++11 support.
- **cURL**: Library for HTTP requests.
- **JSON for Modern C++**: Header-only library for JSON parsing by `nlohmann/json`.

## Dependencies

1. **cURL**: Install via the following commands:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev
    ```

2. **JSON for Modern C++**: Download the header file from [nlohmann/json GitHub page](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) or install via a package manager:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install nlohmann-json3-dev
    ```

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Ensure the necessary libraries (`curl` and `nlohmann/json`) are installed.

3. Add the path to `json.hpp` if it's not already in your include path:
    - Place `json.hpp` in the `include/` directory within the project.

## Compilation

Use the following command to compile the project:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o trading_system -lcurl -I include
