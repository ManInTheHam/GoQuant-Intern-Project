# 🚀 Deribit API Price Fetcher (C++)

This project demonstrates how to connect to the [Deribit cryptocurrency exchange API](https://docs.deribit.com/) using **C++** and **libcurl**, to fetch the latest index prices for major cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH.

---

## 📦 Features

- Fetches real-time index price from Deribit.
- Uses `libcurl` for HTTP requests.
- Clean and extensible structure.
- Command-line interface for symbol input.

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- C++ Compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- libcurl development package

Install libcurl on Debian-based systems:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev


🛠️ How to Build
Clone or download this repository, then compile the code:
g++ deribit.cpp -o deribit -lcurl

▶️ How to Run
Once compiled, run the executable:
./deribit
You'll be prompted to enter a crypto symbol like BTC, ETH, or XRP. The program will then fetch and display the real-time index price from Deribit.


🧠 Code Overview
fetch_from_api(): Handles the GET request to the Deribit endpoint using libcurl.

WriteCallback(): Used by libcurl to store the server's response in a string.

main(): Takes user input, builds the API URL, and prints the result.

🌐 API Endpoint Used

https://www.deribit.com/api/v2/public/get_index_price?index_name=<symbol>-usd
